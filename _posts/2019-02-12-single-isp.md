Singleisp is specially developed for Internet Service Providers. Actually it is an ERP solution for ISP. Main modules of this Software is Radius server (a server application that is using for network authentication, authorization and accounting, link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS), Mikrotik API, Billing automation, Inventory, Earnings and expenses management, Complain management, Integrated Wallet, Android and IOS application, User module, BTRC report etc. I had to work with RouterOs (RouterOS is the operating system of RouterBOARD) in this project. I also developed an UDP server using python and mysql to receive and manage logs form routers like Mikrotik or Cisco.
